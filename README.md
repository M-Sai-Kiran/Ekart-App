# Ekart-App
project

Mongo db server should be installed and running in your pc.
Node js should be installed in your pc.
Ekart express is the server application and erart is the react application.

please run the npm install terminal command in both the folders as node modules are not provided.

please run npm start commmands in express application first and then in react application.

no need to run any db scripts for the project to work.

Any suggestions are welcome.

thank you and have a great day
